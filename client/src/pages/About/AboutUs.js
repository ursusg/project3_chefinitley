          Chefinately provides independent chefs a service to connect with customers who are looking for home-cooked meals. As well as providing chefs with a platform to cater to any number of individuals. 
         A chef can decide whether they’re making a specialty dinner of the day or spending time catering for an event. Customers will be able to specify their need for a specific cuisine and request a specific chef.
